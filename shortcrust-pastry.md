## Ingredients

* 1 ¼ cups white flour
* ½ cup unsalted butter, cubed and chilled
* 3 tbsp water
* 2 tbsp granulated sugar (if you’re using the crust for something sweet)
* ½-1 tsp salt

## Method

1. Add the flour, salt, and sugar (if you’re using it) to a bowl or food processor and mix.
2. Add the cubed butter and mix until it is incorporated and the mixture is the texture of sand.
3. Add the liquid, and mix until it all just barely comes together into a dough.
3. Tip the contents onto a piece of plastic wrap. Use the plastic wrap to shape the dough into a puck shape, and chill it in the refrigerator for at least half an hour.
4. At the end of that time, remove the dough from the refrigerator, and on a lightly floured board, roll it into a circle about an inch wider than your pie pan. 
5. Lay it into the pan, pressing it into the corners so that it fits snugly. Use a fork to perforate the bottom, trim the overhanging dough to half an inch, and then refrigerate for at least half an hour before filling.
